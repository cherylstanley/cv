          <p>I am a sophomore computer science transfer student at Las Positas College who is passionate about web development.
            I ❤️ animals and coffee is my favorite beverage. My goal is to create mobile applications and websites, and hone my skills such that I may be able to help others with projects
            in the technological sector.

  <h3>Education</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Livermore High School: 2014-2018</li>

      <li><a href="https://www.larpd.org/livermore-area-youth-advisory-commission" <strong>Livermore Area Youth Advisory Commission </strong></a> </li>
      <pre emphasized>


          A commission of young people typically in high school who work on projects
          that benefit the community. Had the opportunity to be selected by the mayor
          of Livermore, John Marchand, along with several city council members
          to be a part of this youth commission.

          Some events organized included a Mental Health seminar which was free
          for all community members to partake in, aiming to educate youth on the
          negative impacts stress has on the body and ways to alleviate that stress.
          Another event was a multicultural fair in which we contacted local
          restaurants to cater foods to celebrate multiculturalism in our community,
          and held booths so those interested could learn about the culture from
          each country.

      <li><a href="https://www.nhs.us/" <strong> National Honors Society </strong> </a> </li>
      <pre emphasized>


          A small club consisting of individuals passionate about community
          service who devote a portion of their time to planning and Volunteering
          for events. I served as vice president during my second year in the club.

          Events included a LYSCO charity event where our city (Livermore) hosted
          Japanese exchange students from Livermore's <a href = "http://www.cityoflivermore.net/about/sister.htm" <strong>sister city</strong></a>, Yotsukaido.
          We made the students feel welcome by decorating the hall, making food for
          them, and making art/paintings with words of kindness.

      <li><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/lpc-computer-science-club/home" <strong> Computer Science Club</strong> </a>: 2018-2020
        <pre emphasized>


          Founded the first of its kind my freshman year.
          I served as its president for the first two years
          after its conception in order to get the ball rolling and
          am still a very proud member, happy to see how
          far it's come with help from lots of <strong>great</strong>
          people.

          Activities included field trips, in-club coding challenges,
          hackathons, etc. Organizing these events and the club in general
          helped me interact with peers and get to know fellow CS students.
